The project includes two applications:
 - Windows application built for testing QoS and injecting network packets.
 - Linux applications including both user process and kernel space module, both built for QoS scheduler algorithms in use and the one proposed.

Refer to the paper: "Providing QoS with the Deficit Table Scheduler" by "Rau´l Martı´nez-Mora´ is, Francisco J. Alfaro-Corte´ s, and Jose´ L. Sa´nchez"

This is not an emulation project, all algorithms are run on a linux machine and tested in real-time.

Project report is included.
